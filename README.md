# One-Class-Classification-Anomaly-Detection
A project based on One Class Classification Anomaly Detection to detect defects in hazelnuts like cracks, holes, cuts, ...
This work is based on [DFR](https://github.com/YoungGod/DFR) with the addition of non-local blocks based on self-attention to capture the spatial context and improve the model anomaly recognition capabilities.
